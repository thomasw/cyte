=CyTE Repository Help=

==General Subversion Information==
The CyTE development team currently uses [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] for version control. In order to download the latest development version of CyTE, you will need to have the [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion client] installed locally or on your development machine (alternatively, you can download the latest distribution release on our [http://code.google.com/p/cyte/downloads/list downloads page]).

For more information, including installation instructions, visit http://subversion.tigris.org/.

==Checking out the latest version of CyTE==

  * Repository location: svn checkout http://cyte.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

To Checkout CyTE from the terminal, enter the following (replace '*{local directory}*' with the name of the folder you want Subversion to create the CyTE files in):

{{{
svn checkout http://cyte.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ {local directory}
}}}

==Contributing to the CyTE Repository==
If you are a member of the CyTE Development team, you can contribute code to the repository using the following command (replace '*{user.name}*' with your Google user ID):
{{{
svn checkout https://cyte.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cyte --username {user.name}
}}}

==Using CyTE as a Library==
Browse to the directory that will contain the library folder.
{{{
svn propedit svn:externals .
}}}
It will open an edit window, enter the following
{{{
engine http://cyte.googlecode.com/svn/tags/Latest_Stable/cyte/engine/
}}}
If you want to use a different folder than engine, you can change the $template_conf['engine_path'] in the config file.
